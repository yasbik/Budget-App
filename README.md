# Budget App

This is a project represenging an app for logging expenses and budgeting. The program maintains multiple ledgers of expenses for different categories of spending.

Each category represents a type of expense. An example of the output for a `Food` category would look like:

    *************Food*************
    initial deposit        1000.00
    groceries               -10.15
    restaurant and more foo -15.89
    Transfer to Clothing    -50.00
    Total: 923.96

 The user can depost funds into each category, withdraw funds from them, or even transfer money between different categories.





This is the boilerplate for the Budget App project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/budget-app
